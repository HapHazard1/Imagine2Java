Imagine to Java
Type: Interface.

This texture is an interface between Imagine and a Java Virtual Machine.  The texture will start a Java VM when the texture is loaded.  A Java method in the ImJavaWork class located in the Im2Java directory will be called passing the texture information into the method everytime a ray hit occurs.  After the Java method completes execution, it will return the modified texture information to Imagine.  A class called ImWork in the IM2Java directory must be created.  There must be a public function in the ImWork class called doWork with a return type of void.

REQUESTER TABS:

Params:
These are the user parameters that can be specified at texture application time and saved with the object.
Since a Java method can use these for any conceivable purpose, they are only sixteen entries for generic
paramters without any description of the function of the parameters.
